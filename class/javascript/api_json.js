//api stands for application programming interface 
//when we access data through api , object data is stored in json format
//json stands for javascript object notation (object data is stored here in json format )
//there are two methods to access data in json
//1) parse=====> json.parse()
//used to pass string data to json object

//2) stringify===> json.stringify(data)
//used to pass an js object to json object

//AJAX--IF THERE IS ANY DELAY IN ACCESSING DATA FROM API THEN AJAX MECHANISM WILL HELP IN MANAGING
//THAT DELAY IN DATA WITHOUT RELOADING THE BROWSER BY ASYNCRONOUS METHOD
