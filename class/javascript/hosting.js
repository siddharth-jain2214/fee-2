/* IMPORTANT */
// var can let the variable used even before initialization
// const and let don't let this thing -- according to them , there is nothing above them, and variable can only be accessed after declaration creating temporary death zone.
//if variable is log before declaring in var , it results in undefined , meaning MCP(Memory Creation Phase) has created memory for a , but value is undefined.
//Code execution Phase helps in assigning the values to variables and function stored in MCP.
